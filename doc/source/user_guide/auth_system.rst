===================================
Simple OAuth2 System (experimental)
===================================

Xinference builds an In-memory OAuth2 authentication and authorization system using the account-password mode.

.. note::
   If you don't have authentication and authorization requirements, you can use Xinference as before, without any changes.


Permissions
===========
Currently, Xinference system internally defines some interface permissions:

* ``models:list``: Permission to list models and get models' information.
* ``models:read``: Permission to use models.
* ``models:register``: Permission to register custom models.
* ``models:unregister``: Permission to unregister custom models.
* ``models:start``: Permission to launch models.
* ``models:stop``: Permission to stop running models.
* ``admin``: Administrators have permissions for all interfaces.


Startup
=======
All authentication and authorization information needs to be specified and loaded into memory when Xinference is started.
Xinference requires a JSON-formatted file with the following specific fields:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "auth_config": {
            "algorithm": "HS256",
            "secret_key": "09d25e094faa6ca2556c818166b7a9563b93f7099f6f0f4caa6cf63b88e8d3e7",
            "token_expire_in_minutes": 30
        },
        "user_config": [
            {
                "username": "user1",
                "password": "secret1",
                "permissions": [
                    "admin"
                ],
                "api_keys": [
                    "sk-72tkvudyGLPMi",
                    "sk-ZOTLIY4gt9w11"
                ]
            },
            {
                "username": "user2",
                "password": "secret2",
                "permissions": [
                    "models:list",
                    "models:read"
                ],
                "api_keys": [
                    "sk-35tkasdyGLYMy",
                    "sk-ALTbgl6ut981w"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }


* ``auth_config``: This field is used to configure security-related information.

   * ``algorithm``: The algorithm used for token generation and parsing. ``HS`` series algorithms are recommended. For example, ``HS256``, ``HS384`` or ``HS512``.

   * ``secret_key``: The secret_key used for token generation and parsing. Use this command to generate the secret_key adapted to the ``HS`` algorithms: ``openssl rand -hex 32``.

   * ``token_expire_in_minutes``: Reserved field indicating the expiration time of the token. The current open-source version of Xinference does not check the expiration time of tokens.

* ``user_config``: This field is used to configure user and permission information. Each user information is composed of these fields:

   * ``username``: string field for username.

   * ``password``: string field for password.

   * ``permissions``: A list containing strings representing the permissions that this user has. The permissions are described as above.

   * ``api_keys``: A list containing strings representing the api-keys of this user. With these api-keys, user can access the xinference interfaces without the need to signin. The api-key here is formatted similar to the ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` , always starting with ``sk-``, followed by 13 alphanumeric characters.


Once you have configured such a JSON file, use the ``--auth-config`` option to enable Xinference with the authentication and authorization system. For example, for local startup:

.. code-block:: bash

   xinference-local -H 0.0.0.0 --auth-config /path/to/your_json_config_file


For distributed startup, just specify this option when starting the supervisor:

.. code-block:: bash

   xinference-supervisor -H <supervisor_ip> --auth-config /path/to/your_json_config_file


Usage
=====
For Xinference with the authentication and authorization system enabled, all usage remains the same, except for the addition of a login step at the beginning or using the api-key.

Signin
------
Signin for command line users:

.. code-block:: bash

   xinference login -e <endpoint> --username <username> --password <password>


For python SDK users:

.. code-block:: python

   from xinference.client import Client
   client = Client('<endpoint>')
   client.login('<name>', '<pass>')


For web UI users, when opening the web UI, you will first be directed to the login page. After logging in, you can use the web UI normally.

Api-Key
-------
For command line users, just add ``--api-key`` or ``-ak`` option in the command you want to use.

.. code-block:: bash

   xinference launch <other options> --api-key <your_api_key>


For python SDK users, pass the ``api_key`` parameter when initializing the client, just like the ``OPENAI`` Python client.

.. code-block:: python

   from xinference.client import Client
   client = Client('<endpoint>', api_key='<your_api_key>')


Xinference is also compatible with the ``OPENAI`` Python SDK as well.

.. code-block:: python

   from openai import OpenAI
   client = OpenAI(base_url="<xinference endpoint>" + "/v1", api_key="<your_api_key>")
   client.models.list()

For http request, pass ``Authorization: Bearer api-key`` in request header.

.. code-block::

    curl --request GET \
      --url "<xinference endpoint>" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>"


Http Status Code
================
Add the following two HTTP status codes:

* ``401 Unauthorized``: login information or token verifies failed.
* ``403 Forbidden``: No enough permissions when accessing interfaces.

For the command line, SDK, or web UI users, there will be clear information prompts when encountering authorization and permissions issues.
