"Continuous batching, as a means to improve throughput during model "

" Xinference aims to provide this optimization capability when using the "
"transformers engine as well."

"Once this feature is enabled, all requests for LLMs will be managed by "
"continuous batching, and the average throughput of requests made to a "
"single model will increase. The usage of the LLM interface remains "
"exactly the same as before, with no differences."

"一旦此功能开启，LLM 模型的所有接口将被此功能接管。所有接口的使用方式没有"

"If using GPU inference, this method will consume more GPU memory. Please "
"be cautious when increasing the number of concurrent requests to the same"

"parameter to adjust the concurrency level, with a default value of "
"``16``."

"如果使用 GPU 推理，此功能对显存要求较高。因此请谨慎提高对同一个模型的并发"

"一段时间的测试之后，此功能将代替原来的 transformers 推理逻辑成为默认行为"
