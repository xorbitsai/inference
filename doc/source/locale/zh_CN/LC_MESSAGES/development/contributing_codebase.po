"Xinference is serious about testing and strongly encourages contributors "
"to embrace `test-driven development (TDD) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki"
"/Test-driven_development>`_. This development process \"relies on the "
"repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes "
"an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired "
"improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to "
"pass that test.\" So, before actually writing any code, you should write "
"your tests. Often the test can be taken from the original GitHub issue. "
"However, it is always worth considering additional use cases and writing "
"corresponding tests."
msgstr ""
"Xinference 非常重视测试，并强烈鼓励贡献者采用 `测试驱动开发(TDD) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>`_ 。"
"这种开发过程 \"依赖于非常短的开发周期的重复：首先，开发者编写一个（初始为失败的）自动化测试样例来定义所需的改进或新功能，然后用最少的代码来通过该测试。\""
"因此，在实际编写任何代码之前，您应该编写您的测试样例。通常，测试样例可以从原始的 GitHub issue 中获取。然而，值得考虑额外的情况并编写相应的测试样例。"

"Adding tests is frequently requested after code is pushed to Xinference. "

"this is never an issue."
